# T-R-P-Learning
Program to help students to learn how to calculate Triangle, Rectangle, and Parallelogram.
Provide Tests to students to check how far they understand about the topic.

In a case chosen Triangle, enter base value and height value to calculate the area, or enter base value and area value to calculate the height, 
or enter base area and height value to calculate the base.

In a case chosen Rectangle, enter length value and width value to calculate the area, or enter area value and width value to calculate the length, 
or enter area and length value to calculate the width.

In a case chosen Parallelogram, enter base value and height value to calculate the area, or enter base value and area value to calculate the height, 
or enter base area and height value to calculate the base.

Calculate the value based on the user input:
 For Triangle:
I. To Calculate area, area = (base * height) / 2.
II. To Calculate height, height = (2 * area) / base.
III. To Calculate base, base = (area / height) * 2.

 For Rectangle and Parallelogram:
I. To Calculate area, area = base (or width) * height (or length).
II. To Calculate height (or length), height (or length) = (2 * area) / base (or width).
III. To Calculate base, base (or width) = (area / height (or length)) * 2.
